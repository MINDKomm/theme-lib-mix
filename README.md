# Mix

A [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) function for WordPress themes.

The mix function is useful if you want to enable **cache busting** for your theme asset files (CSS, JavaScript, images, icon sprites). Laravel Mix allows you to create a `mix-manifest.json` file, which might look like this:

```json
{
    "/css/styles.css": "/css/styles.css?id=6ed48b0b831e80bd7549",
    "/js/scripts.js": "/js/scripts.js?id=1bdd07b944e933aa88aa",
}
```

The ID parameter is a hash of the file contents that changes every time that you make a change to a file. The `mix()` and `mix_any()` functions provided in this package allow you to use these hashed URLs for enqueueing your assets in your WordPress theme.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require mindkomm/theme-lib-mix
```

## Usage

The mix function assumes that you have a `mix-manifest.json` (generated by the [version function of Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/blob/master/docs/versioning.md)) in the `build` folder of your theme.

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', function() {
    wp_enqueue_style(
        'styles',
        mix( 'build/css/styles.css' )
    );
} );
```

If the mix function can’t find your asset file in the manifest file, it will return the asset URL through [`get_theme_file_uri`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_theme_file_uri/) as a fallback.

## Functions

| Name | Return Type | Summary/Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [mix](#mix) | `string` | Gets the path to a versioned Mix file in a theme.<br><br>*Returns:* The versioned file URL. |
| [mix_any](#mix_any) | `string` | Gets the path to a versioned Mix file.<br><br>*Returns:* The versioned file URL. |

### mix

Gets the path to a versioned Mix file in a theme.

Use this function if you want to load theme dependencies. This function will cache the contents
of the manifest file for you. This also means that you can’t work with different mix locations.
For that, you’d need to use `mix_any()`.

Inspired by <https://www.sitepoint.com/use-laravel-mix-non-laravel-projects/>.

**since** 1.0.0 

`mix( string $path, string $manifest_directory = build )`

**Returns:** `string` The versioned file URL.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $path | `string` | The relative path to the file. |
| $manifest_directory | `string` | Optional. Custom path to manifest directory. Default 'build'. |

---

### mix\_any

Gets the path to a versioned Mix file.

The difference to the `mix()` function is that for this function, you need to provide the
absolute paths to the file and the manifest directory. The benefit is that it’s more versatile
and that you can use it for functionality that might not live in a theme, but in a plugin or a
symlinked package.

**since** 1.1.0 

`mix_any( string $path, string $manifest_directory, string $manifest_name = mix-manifest.json )`

**Returns:** `string` The versioned file URL.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $path | `string` | The full path to the file. |
| $manifest_directory | `string` | The full path to the manifest directory. |
| $manifest_name | `string` | Optional. The name of the manifest file in `$manifest_directory`. Default `mix-manifest.json`. |
